Process...

== Create local branch ==

Before you code anything, create a local branch of the code and check it out to start working in it.


'git branch <descriptive name of work>'

'git checkout <descriptive name of work>'

== Make your changes ==

<Edit files to your liking>

Oh and test your changes ... until you're ready to share.

== Commit them to your local branch ==

'git status'
'git add .'
'git status'
'git commit -m "comment about changes"'

== Minimize changes vs the master by getting the latest ==

'git fetch'
'git rebase origin/master'
'git checkout master'
'git pull'
'git rebase <yourbranch>'

== Push your local branch to prepare for Pull-Request ==

'git push origin <branch name>'

Assuming you are using github.com...

Go into Github.com dashboard, find your new branch and click the button to start a pull-request. Enter a description as needed.
